Hi! 

This Repo is for showcasing the code from my second year specialization project! Especially written for our In-House engine called **Friendship Engine** created by a team of 6 programmers (including me) during the second year of our Game programming education at The Game Assembly. 

Please note that I've only picked code that's relevant for my specialization, a lot of stuff has been left out such as the entire engine it was made for :)
